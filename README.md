# DryBeans
Dry Bean Classification Project using Machine Learning
Hello! This is my Machine Learning project where I use two algorithms, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to classify dry beans based on 16 attributes of the beans from a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
My goal is to incorporate additional factors such as sunlight exposure, water usage, and soil health to determine optimal conditions for maximizing the yield of each bean variety.
